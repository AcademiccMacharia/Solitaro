# Solitaro

**Solitaro** is a _captivating and innovative_ social media application that I developed with the aim of connecting people from all walks of life through shared interests and unique experiences. The name "SOlitaro" is derived from the words "solitary" and "tarot," symbolizing the application's core philosophy of fostering individual connections and predicting meaningful connections among its users.
